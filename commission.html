                <h4> Process </h4>
                <p><b>You need to have a Ko-Fi account first since the payment for the commission will be done through Ko-Fi.</b>
                We'll start the commission by you first discuss what you want from the commission through the chat in the Ko-Fi commission page.</p>
                <p>After we have an agreement on what to be drawn for the commission <b>you can purchase with the price listed on the commission listing.</b>
                When the purchase of said commission has been confirmed I'll start drawing your commission, this will take around 1-20 days accounting
                others who also have purchased this service, for each artwork it'll be done in around 1-3 days per commission.
                </p>
                <p>Along the time I'll be working on your piece, I'll send you the WIP (Work in Progress) for each illustration passes being done.
                This'll help you confirm on the progress and also gives more specific directions that you want on the illustration along the way.
                But mind you if you want changes from the ground up or the overall layout of the illustration is largely changed, <b>I won't comply with those changes.</b>
                </p>
                <p>When the illustration commission has been deemed as done, I'll be putting up the finished commission on your commission queue in Ko-Fi.
                I'll notify you when it's done through your DM in socials or Discord.</p>
                <h4> Payments </h4>
                <p>All commission payments will be done through my Ko-Fi's commission listings.</p>
                <h4> Edits </h4>
                <p>I'll only comply for smaller changes that does not change the overall piece, any large changes like overall composition is something that I won't comply.</p>
                <h4> Copyright </h4>
                <p>I have the full copyright of the commission. You cannot profit from the work that I've made, I'll only allow usages for personal use or non profit causes.</p>
                <h4> Refusal </h4>
                <p>I won't accept commissions for NSFW, Furry, and Mecha work.</p>
                <h3 id="FUTURE"> Future Plans </h3>
                <h4>Will there be more types of commissions coming soon?</h4>
                <p>Yes, absolutely. But for now I want to test the waters, and am also working on getting used to working on comms and setting a good time schedule alongside comms and other projects.</p>
